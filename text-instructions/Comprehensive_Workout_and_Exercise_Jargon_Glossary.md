Comprehensive Workout and Exercise Jargon
Glossary
Fundamental Exercise Terms (Reps, Sets, Rounds, etc.)
Repetition (Rep)  – One complete movement of an exercise. For example, one push-up or one squat
is one rep . Workouts often prescribe a number of reps to perform consecutively. 
Set – A group of consecutive repetitions performed without stopping . For example, 3 sets of 10
reps means you do 10 reps, rest, and repeat for a total of 3 rounds of 10. 
Round  – Completing a series of different exercises one after another . Once every listed exercise is
done, that counts as 1 round . Workouts may call for multiple rounds (similar to circuits) of a
sequence of exercises. 
Rest  – A pause between sets or rounds to recover . For instance, 90s rest  means rest for 90 seconds
before the next set/round . Proper rest ensures you can perform the next set with good intensity
and form. 
Warm-Up Set  – A lighter set performed before the main working sets of an exercise. It prepares the
muscles and nervous system, usually done with less weight than the “working” sets . 
Top Set  – The heaviest (or final) set of a given exercise in a workout. Lifters often work up to a top set
at high intensity as the peak effort for that exercise . 
Workout Structure and Format Terms
Superset  – Performing two exercises back-to-back without rest  in between . After completing
both exercises, then you rest. (If the two exercises target the same  muscle group, this is sometimes
called a compound set .) Supersets save time and can increase intensity by working different
muscles or the same muscle in succession. 
Tri-Set / Giant Set  – Similar to a superset, but stringing 3 exercises  (tri-set) or 4+ exercises  (giant
set) together with no rest between them . After completing all exercises in sequence, one round
is done and you may rest. This is a high-intensity technique to increase training density. 
Circuit  – A sequence of several exercises performed one after another with minimal rest, targeting
different body parts or cardio. Completing one set of each exercise in the list constitutes one circuit
(or one round) . Often circuits are repeated for multiple rounds. This is a common format in
bootcamp and HIIT workouts. 
Drop Set  – A weightlifting technique  where you perform an exercise until muscle fatigue, then
immediately reduce the weight and continue without rest . You might drop the weight 1–3 times,
pushing the muscle to exhaustion. Drop sets are used to increase intensity and muscle fatigue in a
short time. 
Pyramid Set  – A set/rep scheme where you increase weight and decrease reps each set
(ascending pyramid) or do the reverse, or both. For example, a classic pyramid might be 12 reps
(light), then 10, 8, 6 reps as weight increases . A reverse pyramid starts heavy with low reps and
then lowers weight and increases reps. Pyramids allow training across different rep ranges in one
exercise. •

Ladder  – A workout structure where repetitions ascend or descend each set  in a systematic way
. For example, in an ascending ladder you might do 1 rep, then 2, 3, and so on each set; or a
descending ladder might go 10-9-8... down to 1. The weight usually stays the same (or inversely
changes with reps). Ladders pack volume into a workout efficiently by adjusting reps each set . 
AMRAP  – Stands for “ As Many Reps (or Rounds) As Possible .” In strength training, an AMRAP set
means doing as many repetitions as possible (often to failure). In conditioning or CrossFit, an AMRAP
workout  means performing as many rounds  of a circuit as possible in a given time frame . For
example, a 10-minute AMRAP of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 squats means cycling through those
reps repeatedly for 10 minutes. 
EMOM  – Stands for “ Every Minute on the Minute .” In an EMOM format, you start a specific exercise
or set of exercises at the top of each minute, then rest for whatever time remains in that minute .
For instance, EMOM 10 min: do 10 burpees at the start of every minute – if it takes you 30 seconds,
you rest the remaining 30 seconds, then repeat next minute. This structure manages work and rest
cyclically . 
Interval Training  – Any workout alternating between periods of high intensity and lower intensity or
rest. For example, 30 seconds of sprinting followed by 30 seconds of walking, repeated. HIIT  (High-
Intensity Interval Training) is a form of interval training characterized by short bursts of very intense
effort alternated with recovery periods . Interval training improves cardiovascular fitness and can
burn calories efficiently. 
Tabata  – A specific HIIT protocol developed by Dr . Izumi Tabata. It involves 20 seconds of all-out
effort  followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for 8 rounds (totaling 4 minutes) . A classic Tabata
workout might use one exercise (e.g., sprinting or squats), or alternate exercises in those 8 rounds.
It’s a very intense short workout format. 
For Time  – This indicates the workout is a task to complete as fast as possible  (recording your total
time). Common in CrossFit, a workout “for time” has a prescribed amount of work (rounds/reps), and
your goal is to finish it quickly while maintaining good form . For example, 3 rounds for time: 400m
run, 20 kettlebell swings, 20 box jumps  – you’d record how long it took to do 3 rounds. If a time cap is
given, you stop at that time even if unfinished. 
Chipper  – A type of workout consisting of a long sequence of different exercises (often high reps)
completed one after another , usually only one round  through . It’s called “chipper” because
you chip away at the list. For example, a chipper might be: 50 air squats, 40 sit-ups, 30 kettlebell
swings, 20 burpees, 10 pull-ups – completed for time. Chippers are typically brutal endurance
challenges and done as fast as possible (for time). 
WOD  – Stands for “ Workout of the Day .” Popularized in CrossFit, it refers to the prescribed workout
for a given day . A WOD could be any format (AMRAP, EMOM, chipper , etc.). In CrossFit
communities, WODs are often named (e.g., “Murph” is a famous WOD) and usually timed or scored.
If someone says “today’s WOD is 5×5 back squat,” it just means that’s the day’s workout. 
Metcon  – Short for Metabolic Conditioning , often used interchangeably with a conditioning circuit
or HIIT-style workout. It emphasizes high-intensity, usually full-body movements to tax both
muscular and cardiovascular systems . In practice, a “metcon” usually refers to a short, intense
circuit designed to improve endurance and metabolic fitness (e.g., a 10-minute AMRAP of various
exercises could be called a metcon). 
Compound Exercise  – (Related term) An exercise that engages multiple muscle groups  or joints at
once (e.g., squat, which uses hips, knees, and ankles). Compound movements are the opposite of
isolation exercises and often form the core of strength workouts . (We mention this because terms
like “compound set” or discussing workouts might refer to compound vs isolation movements.)•

Types of Workouts and Training Styles
Strength Training  – Workouts focused on lifting heavy weights for low-to-moderate repetitions to
increase muscular strength. This typically involves compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press) and
programming of sets/reps aimed at progressive overload. Strength workouts often use 1–6 rep
ranges with heavier loads and longer rest. (Powerlifting routines are a prime example of strength-
focused workouts.) 
Hypertrophy Training (Bodybuilding)  – Workouts designed to build muscle size. They usually
involve moderate weight for moderate reps (e.g. 8–15 reps), higher volume of sets, and exercises
targeting specific muscles. Bodybuilding-style workouts might include isolation movements and
techniques like supersets or drop sets to thoroughly fatigue muscles. The goal is muscle growth
(hypertrophy) rather than pure strength. 
Endurance Training  – Workouts aimed at improving muscular or cardiovascular endurance. In the
gym context, this could mean higher-rep weight training (15+ reps per set) or circuit training with
minimal rest. In cardio context, it means sustained aerobic exercise like distance running, cycling, or
swimming. Endurance workouts train the body’s ability to perform for extended periods and resist
fatigue . 
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)  – A broad category of workouts featuring repeated high-
intensity efforts interspersed with rest or low-intensity periods . Sessions are typically short (10–
30 minutes) because of the intensity. This style can include sprint intervals, circuit intervals, Tabata
protocols, and more. The goal is to improve cardio fitness, burn fat, and increase anaerobic
endurance. 
Circuit Training / Bootcamp  – Workouts where you move through a series of exercises (stations)
with little rest (akin to the circuit format described above). Bootcamp  is a term often used for high-
energy group circuit workouts mixing cardio and strength moves . These styles target both
strength and cardio in the same session and keep the heart rate up. 
CrossFit  – A branded fitness regimen known for mixing weightlifting, gymnastics, and metabolic
conditioning in varied workouts. CrossFit workouts often have functional movements, are done for
time or reps (score), and use terms like WOD, AMRAP, EMOM, etc. (Many of the jargon terms in this
list originate from CrossFit culture.) CrossFit “Workouts of the Day” can range from heavy barbell
lifting to endurance circuits or skill-based gymnastics. 
Powerlifting  – A training style specific to the sport of powerlifting, focusing on maximal strength in
three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift . Powerlifting workouts involve low-rep, high-
weight sets of those core lifts, often with long rests and accessory work to strengthen those
movements. The goal is increasing one-rep max strength. 
Olympic Weightlifting  – Training centered on the two Olympic lifts: the snatch  and the clean & jerk
. These workouts emphasize explosive power , technique, and flexibility. Sets are typically low-rep
(1–5) with focus on form and speed. Accessory exercises (front squats, pulls, presses) are included to
support the main lifts. Olympic lifting terminology: you might see “EMOM Snatches” or complex drills
(e.g., hang clean + jerk). 
Bodyweight Training (Calisthenics)  – Workouts using your own body weight as resistance, rather
than external weights. These include exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, squats, lunges, burpees,
planks, dips, etc. Calisthenics can be structured into circuits, AMRAPs, or just sets/reps. Advanced
calisthenics includes movements like muscle-ups and handstand push-ups. It improves strength
relative to body weight and often requires significant core and stabilizer engagement. 
Functional Training  – A style focusing on movements that mimic real-life activities and improve
overall functional ability (balance, coordination, stability). It often uses exercises that engage•

multiple muscle groups (e.g., kettlebell swings, farmer’s carries, single-leg movements) . The idea
is to train your body for better performance in daily tasks or sports. Many CrossFit and circuit
workouts are considered functional training. 
Mobility and Flexibility Work  – Some routines (like yoga or dedicated mobility sessions) focus on
improving range of motion, joint health, and muscle flexibility. Yoga  is a practice emphasizing
flexibility, balance, and bodyweight strength via various poses (asanas) and breathing techniques
. Pilates  is a low-impact system emphasizing core strength, stability, and muscle control .
These might not appear as “Instagram workouts” with sets/reps, but are common styles of exercise
that sometimes get incorporated (e.g., “15 min yoga flow for cooldown” or mobility drills in warm-
ups). 
Metabolic Conditioning (Metcon)  – (As mentioned above in jargon) a style of workout aimed at
elevating the heart rate and challenging muscles continuously. CrossFit “metcon” workouts are
typically short circuits or interval workouts. Outside CrossFit, any workout that blends cardio and
strength in a high-intensity way (circuit training, HIIT, etc.) could be called a metabolic conditioning
workout. 
Note:  Many real training programs combine elements of these styles. For example, a PPL split  (Push/Pull/
Legs) is a common weekly routine: push day for chest/shoulders/triceps, pull day for back/biceps, leg day
for  lower  body .  A  bro  split  might  have  chest  day,  back  day,  arm  day,  etc.  Understanding  these
categories helps parse workout descriptions (e.g., “Leg day ” implies a lower-body focused workout, likely
strength or hypertrophy oriented).
Common Workout Focus and Split Terms
Full-Body Workout  – A session that targets all major muscle groups in one workout (e.g., combining
upper , lower , and core exercises) . Many circuit training sessions or beginner programs use full-
body workouts. If an Instagram caption says “full body burn,” it means the routine isn’t limited to
one body part. 
Upper/Lower Split  – A routine structure where some days are dedicated to upper-body exercises
and others to lower-body exercises. For example, an upper-body day (chest, back, arms, shoulders)
and a lower-body day (legs, glutes). Captions might reference this like “upper body blast” or “leg day”
indicating the focus. 
Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)  – A three-day rotation workout split: one day focuses on push  muscles (chest,
shoulders, triceps – movements where you push away), one on pull muscles (back, biceps –
movements where you pull), and one on legs . This is a popular intermediate split. In parsing, if
someone mentions “push day” or “pull day,” it’s about that portion of the split. 
Leg Day / Arm Day / Back Day  – Colloquial terms for a workout focused on a specific body region. 
Leg day  refers to training the lower body (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves). Arm day  hits biceps and
triceps (and often forearms). Back day  hits back muscles (and often biceps). Chest day  focuses on
chest (and usually triceps/shoulders). These are common in bodybuilding splits. A caption might say
“Never skip leg day ,” indicating a tough lower-body workout. 
Core Workout  – A session emphasizing core muscles (abs, obliques, lower back). Many IG workouts
label “core burn” or “abs finisher ,” which means lots of planks, crunches, leg raises, etc., often high-
rep or timed circuits to target abdominal muscles. 
Cardio  – Any workout primarily targeting cardiovascular endurance. In a gym context, “cardio” could
mean treadmill runs, cycling, rowing, jump rope, or bodyweight cardio circuits. If a workout caption
mentions “cardio finisher: 10 min run” or uses tags like #cardioworkout, it implies an aerobic focus. 29

LISS  (Low-Intensity Steady State) and HIIT  are two ends of the cardio spectrum – a slow 30-min jog
vs. short high-intensity intervals. 
Common Exercises (with Explanations)
Below is a non-exhaustive list of popular exercises that often appear in workout descriptions, grouped by
the area they target. (There are countless exercises; this covers many of the fundamental movements and
those frequently seen in fitness posts.)
Upper Body – Chest & Shoulders:
- Push-Up  – A classic bodyweight press movement performed face-down: you push your body up from the
ground by extending your arms. Push-ups work the chest, shoulders, and triceps (and engage the core) .
Variations include knee push-ups (easier), incline/decline push-ups, etc.
-  Bench Press  – The primary weightlifting exercise for chest. Lying on a bench, you press a barbell or
dumbbells up from the chest. Bench presses build the pectorals, front shoulders, and triceps . Often
listed with a weight (e.g., barbell bench press) and sets/reps.
- Overhead Press (OHP)  – Lifting a weight (barbell or dumbbells) straight overhead from shoulder height.
Also  called  military  press.  Strengthens  the  shoulders  (deltoids),  triceps,  and  upper  back  stabilizers.  If
specified as standing , it engages core and legs for stability.
- Dumbbell Fly  – An isolation chest exercise where you lie on a bench and “fly” two dumbbells out and in,
focusing on pecs. Often appears in hypertrophy workouts (e.g., 3×12 chest flyes).
-  Lateral  Raise  –  A  shoulder  isolation  move  with  dumbbells  raised  out  to  the  sides,  targeting  lateral
deltoids. Common in shoulder/upper body days.
- Shoulder Press  – Could refer to dumbbell shoulder press (seated or standing) similar to overhead press,
or machine shoulder press. Works the shoulder muscles and triceps.
- Pull-Over  – A dumbbell or machine exercise working the upper chest and lats, performed lying down by
lowering a weight overhead and pulling it back up. Sometimes seen in chest or back workouts.
Upper Body – Back & Arms:
- Pull-Up / Chin-Up  – A bodyweight pulling exercise where you hang from a bar and pull your body up. Pull-
ups (palms facing away) target the upper back (lats, traps) and biceps; chin-ups (palms facing toward you)
emphasize biceps more. Often programmed as max reps or in sets (e.g., 3 sets to failure). If someone writes
“assisted pull-ups,” they might use a band or machine for help.
- Bent-Over Row  – A weight training move where you bend at the waist and pull a barbell or dumbbells
toward your torso, engaging the back muscles (lats, rhomboids) and biceps. Variations: barbell row, single-
arm dumbbell row, etc. Rows are staple back exercises.
-  Deadlift  – A fundamental full-body lift, categorized as a back/leg exercise. You lift a weight (usually a
barbell)  from  the  ground  to  standing  hip-locked  position .  Deadlifts  primarily  work  the  glutes,
hamstrings, and lower back, plus upper back and grip. Often programs list heavy deadlift sets (e.g., 5×5
deadlifts).  Variants  include  Romanian  Deadlift  (RDL)  –  which  targets  hamstrings  more  by  keeping  legs
slightly straighter .
- Biceps Curl  – An isolation exercise for the biceps. Typically done with dumbbells or a barbell, curling the
weight up by bending the elbow. Variations: hammer curl (neutral grip), barbell curl, cable curl. If a workout
says “21s” – that’s a bicep curl technique doing partials and full range curls.
-  Triceps Extension  – Isolation for triceps, involving extending the arm at the elbow against resistance.
Could be overhead triceps extensions (dumbbell or cable), lying triceps extensions (a.k.a skullcrushers), or
cable push-downs. If a caption mentions “skullcrusher 3×10,” that’s a lying triceps extension .34

-  Dip – An upper-body bodyweight exercise mainly for triceps (and chest/front shoulders). Performed on
parallel bars or bench (bench dips). Many workouts include “dips – 3 x max reps” or similar for arm strength.
- Barbell Row  – (See Bent-Over Row) Usually implies a barbell. If just “Row” is listed, context matters – could
be a barbell/dumbbell row (strength exercise) or a rowing machine (cardio). In a weights context, assume a
strength movement; in a circuit with distance (like 500m row), it means using a rowing ergometer . 
Lower Body – Legs & Glutes:
- Squat  – The king of lower body exercises. In a basic squat, you bend at the hips and knees to lower down
as if sitting back, then stand up . Variations: Barbell Back Squat  (bar on back), Front Squat  (bar in front on
shoulders), Goblet Squat  (holding a dumbbell/kettlebell in front), Bodyweight Squat . Squats target the quads,
glutes, and hamstrings, with core stabilization. A workout caption might say “Back Squat 5×5 @ 80% 1RM”
indicating heavy strength squats.
- Lunge  – A unilateral leg exercise where you step forward or backward and bend the front knee (and back
knee) in a split stance.  Walking lunges  involve stepping forward each rep;  reverse lunges  step back.
Lunges target quads and glutes (and challenge balance). Often prescribed for reps per leg (e.g., “Walking
Lunges – 20 steps (10 each leg)”). Variations: Bulgarian Split Squat (rear foot elevated lunge), Jumping
lunges (plyometric).
- Deadlift  – (Covered above in back, but also a major leg/glute exercise). Specifically, Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
is often listed in leg workouts – that version keeps tension on hamstrings by not lowering the bar all the
way  to  the  floor ,  focusing  on  a  deep  hamstring  stretch .  Stiff-Leg  Deadlift  is  similar ,  emphasizing
hamstrings.
- Leg Press  – A machine exercise where you press a platform with your feet, extending the legs. It targets
similar muscles to squats (quads, glutes). If someone lists a weight (e.g., leg press 200 lbs), it usually doesn’t
count the sled weight, just plates added (varies by machine).
- Leg Curl / Leg Extension  – Isolation machine moves for hamstrings (leg curl) and quads (leg extension).
Sometimes included in accessory work for legs.
- Calf Raise  – An exercise for the calf muscles. Can be done with a machine, dumbbells, or just bodyweight
(standing on a step and raising heels). Often high reps (calves endure volume). A workout might list “3×15
calf raises” as a finisher .
- Hip Thrust / Glute Bridge  – A focused glute exercise where you bridge your hips upward. Hip thrusts  are
typically with back against a bench and a barbell on the hips; glute bridges  are similar but usually from the
floor (often bodyweight). Popular in “glute day” or lower-body routines for isolating gluteus maximus.
Full-Body & Dynamic Movements:
-  Burpee  – A notorious full-body bodyweight move. A standard burpee involves dropping into a squat
thrust/plank, often doing a push-up, then jumping back up to standing with a hop . It’s a combo of
squat, plank/push-up, and jump. Burpees are often programmed in conditioning circuits or finishers (e.g.,
“10 burpees between each exercise” or AMRAP of burpees).
-  Thruster  – A compound movement combining a front squat and a push press in one fluid motion.
Performed typically with a barbell or dumbbells: squat down with the weight at shoulders and then press
overhead as you stand. Thrusters are common in CrossFit WODs and brutally effective (e.g., “Fran” WOD is
thrusters and pull-ups). If you see “dumbbell thrusters 3×10” – that’s the move.
-  Kettlebell Swing  – A dynamic hip-dominant exercise with a kettlebell. You swing the KB from between
your legs up to about chest level (Russian swing) or overhead (American swing) by forcefully snapping the
hips (hip extension). It works the glutes, hamstrings, and core, and is also a cardio move. Often appears in
circuits (e.g., “20 kettlebell swings” as part of a round).
-  Clean & Jerk / Snatch  – These are Olympic lift movements. A  clean  is lifting a barbell from ground to37

shoulders in one motion (often with a little jump and squat, known as a power clean or full clean). A jerk  is
then driving the bar overhead from the shoulders. A snatch  is a single explosive movement lifting the bar
from ground to overhead in one motion. If a workout lists these (e.g., “Hang Clean 5×3” or “Snatch EMOM
10”), it’s likely a strength or CrossFit session. Technical to parse, but usually they’ll be clear .
-  Farmer’s Carry (Farmer’s Walk)  – Carrying heavy weights (dumbbells, kettlebells, or special farmer’s
handles) in each hand while walking a distance. Great for grip, traps, and core. Captions might say “100m
farmer’s carry” (as seen in the example) which is essentially walking 100m with heavy DBs . Sometimes
specified with weight, e.g., “Farmer’s carry 2×50 lb dumbbells, 100m”.
- Box Jump  – A plyometric move where you jump from the ground onto a sturdy box or platform, then step
or jump down. Often programmed for explosive power or conditioning (e.g., “10 box jumps” in a circuit). In
cross-training posts, box height might be given (like 24″ for men, 20″ for women as common Rx).
-  Wall Ball  – A CrossFit favorite: a medicine ball is thrown against a wall target from a squat. One rep is
squatting with the med ball and driving up to throw it ~10 feet high on the wall . Commonly appears in
WODs (e.g., “20 Wall Ball shots”).
- Mountain Climbers  – A core/cardio move in plank position where you rapidly drive knees toward chest
alternately, as if “running” horizontally. Often done for time or high reps in HIIT circuits.
- Plank  – An isometric core exercise where you hold a push-up-like position (on hands or elbows) keeping
the body straight. Planks strengthen the abs and stabilizers . Variations: side plank, forearm plank, etc.
In captions usually denoted by time (e.g., “1 min plank hold”).
- Medicine Ball Slam  – Lifting a medicine ball overhead and slamming it down to the ground, using core
and arms forcefully. A power exercise that often appears in conditioning workouts.
- Skater Jumps (Lateral Bounds)  – Side-to-side single-leg jumps mimicking a speed skater’s motion. Often
for athletic conditioning or leg power , mentioned in HIIT routines.
- Bear Crawl  – A conditioning movement where you crawl on hands and feet. Sometimes seen in bootcamp
style workouts (“bear crawl 20m”).
-  Battle Ropes  – Thick ropes you whip in waves. If a caption says “:30 battle rope waves,” it means 30
seconds of slamming ropes up and down – a tough upper-body cardio exercise.
(Many other exercises exist, but the above covers a wide range of common ones you’ll encounter. For a specific app
database, you would include each exercise name and possibly categorize them by muscle group or equipment.)
Common Equipment Terms:  When parsing captions, it’s useful to recognize equipment abbreviations and
names, as they often imply how an exercise is done or what to prepare:
Barbell (BB)  – A long weighted bar for exercises like squat, deadlift, bench press. Often loaded with 
plates  (weight discs). Barbells allow heavy lifts . (In text, “BB Back Squat” means barbell back
squat.) 
Dumbbell (DB)  – A short hand-held weight. Dumbbells are used in pairs or single for a variety of
exercises (e.g., DB curls, DB lunges) . 
Kettlebell (KB)  – A round weight with a handle (looks like a cannonball with a handle) used for
swings, goblet squats, presses, and more dynamic moves . e.g., “KB Swing” for kettlebell swing. 
Bodyweight (BW)  – Indicates no external weight; using one’s own body. A bodyweight exercise  uses
body mass as resistance (push-ups, pull-ups, etc.) . Sometimes “BW x 10” could mean 10 reps with
just bodyweight (commonly noted in calisthenics). 
Machine  – Could refer to various weight machines at the gym (leg press machine, cable machine,
etc.). If a caption specifies machine (e.g., “machine chest press 3×12”), they’re using a guided
machine rather than free weights. 40

Cable  – Cable pulley machines are often referenced for certain moves (e.g., “cable triceps
pushdown”). The presence of “cable” means using a weight stack cable system which provides
constant tension. 
Medicine Ball (Med Ball)  – A weighted ball used in exercises like slams, tosses, or as added
resistance . Often noted if used (e.g., med ball squat throws). 
Resistance Band  – Elastic bands used for assistance or added resistance in exercises . For
example, “banded pull-ups” (using a band for assistance) or “band glute bridge”. 
Bench  – A weight bench, used for exercises like bench press, step-ups, or hip thrusts (bench as
support). If an exercise says “on bench” (e.g., dumbbell rows on bench), it indicates body position. 
Box – A sturdy plyometric box for jumps or step-ups. E.g., “24″ box” for box jump height. 
TRX / Rings  – Suspension trainers. TRX is a brand; rings are gymnastic rings. Workouts might say
“TRX rows” or “ring dips,” indicating those apparatus. 
Sandbag  – A heavy sand-filled bag used like free weights. E.g., “sandbag lunges” (as seen in an
example) or “sandbag carry”. 
Sled  – A weighted sled to push or pull (common in athletic training). If “sled pushes” appear , that’s
what it means. 
Erg – Short for ergometer machines: Row erg  (rower), SkiErg  (ski simulator), Assault Bike  or Echo Bike
(fan bikes). If a workout says “500m row” or “1k ski,” it implies these cardio machines for that
distance. 
Mat  – Just a floor mat (for abs or stretching). Usually not critical in parsing, but if they say “mat
drills,” it’s just floor exercises.
Data Format Considerations (Database vs JSON for Next.js)
When building a Next.js mobile web app, you have a choice of how to store and retrieve this “workout
jargon” database. The two main options are storing the terms in a database  or in a JSON  (or other static
data format). Given the context:
The list of exercises/terms is relatively static (a defined glossary that won’t change frequently, except
to add new terms occasionally). 
The volume is moderate (perhaps a few hundred terms at most, including exercises and jargon).
For such static or slowly-changing reference data, using a  JSON file or in-code data structure  is often
more efficient and simpler than a full database. You can bundle the JSON with the app or fetch it as needed,
avoiding an extra database query. This reduces complexity: no need for running a database or making API
calls for something that doesn’t frequently update. As one expert notes, if you have only a few hundred
static objects and no frequent writes, “go ahead with JSON” – a database would be unnecessary overhead
. 
In a Next.js app, you could include this data as a JSON file and load it at build time or runtime easily. Next.js
supports Static Generation  (you could bake the terms into the app at build) or Server-side Rendering  to
fetch  data,  but  for  static  glossary  info,  Static  Generation  (or  even  just  importing  a  JSON)  is  ideal  for
performance. This way, the data can be delivered quickly to the client without an extra round-trip to a server
or database. •

A database might be warranted if: - The data were huge (thousands of items such that loading all at once is
slow or memory heavy – not the case here). - The data changed frequently or needed user contributions/
edits. - You needed advanced querying that’s hard to do in-memory.
Since that’s not currently needed, a flat file (JSON) or a lightweight local database (like indexed DB or SQLite
if offline usage needed) would both work. Conclusion:  For a Next.js mobile web app, keeping this reference
as a static JSON (or a small in-app database seed) is more efficient and simpler to maintain in the short term
. You can always migrate to a cloud database later if requirements grow.
Proposed Data Template/Standard (JSON Structure)
To integrate this glossary of workouts/exercises into your app, it’s helpful to have a clear JSON schema or
structure. This ensures the parser knows how to classify and retrieve info. Here’s a suggested template for
organizing the data:
{
"exerciseTerms" :[
{
"term":"AMRAP",
"category" :"format" ,
"definition" :"As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible – complete as many 
repetitions or rounds in a given time."
},
{
"term":"EMOM",
"category" :"format" ,
"definition" :
"Every Minute On the Minute – start an exercise each minute, using remaining 
time to rest."
},
{
"term":"Superset" ,
"category" :"structure" ,
"definition" :"Two exercises performed back-to-back without rest."
},
{
"term":"Drop Set" ,
"category" :"technique" ,
"definition" :"Perform reps to failure, reduce weight, continue without 
rest to extend the set."
}
// ... more jargon terms
],
"exercises" :[
{
"name":"Push-Up" ,49
9

"muscle_groups" :["chest","shoulders" ,"triceps" ,"core"],
"equipment" :"bodyweight" ,
"description" :"A bodyweight press-up from the floor targeting the chest, 
arms, and core."
},
{
"name":"Back Squat" ,
"muscle_groups" :["quadriceps" ,"glutes" ,"hamstrings" ],
"equipment" :"barbell" ,
"description" :"Barbell squat with the bar resting on the upper back/
traps."
},
{
"name":"Kettlebell Swing" ,
"muscle_groups" :["glutes" ,"hamstrings" ,"back","core"],
"equipment" :"kettlebell" ,
"description" :"Explosive hip-driving swing of a kettlebell from between 
the legs to eye level."
}
// ... more exercises
],
"workoutStyles" :[
{
"name":"HIIT",
"description" :"High-Intensity Interval Training, alternating intense 
bursts with rest."
},
{
"name":"Strength Training" ,
"description" :"Weightlifting focused on low-rep heavy sets to build 
maximal strength."
},
{
"name":"CrossFit" ,
"description" :"Functional training program with varied high-intensity 
workouts (WODs)."
}
// ... more styles or categories
],
"equipment" :[
{"name":"Barbell" ,"description" :"Long bar used with weight plates for 
heavy lifts." },
{"name":"Dumbbell" ,"description" :"Handheld free weight for various 
exercises." },
{"name":"Kettlebell" ,"description" :"Cannonball-shaped weight with a 
handle, used for dynamic exercises." },
{"name":"Bodyweight" ,"description" :"No equipment – using one’s own body 
as resistance." }
10

// ... more equipment if needed
],
"bodyParts" :[
{"name":"Legs","description" :"Lower body muscles including quads, 
hamstrings, glutes, calves." },
{"name":"Chest","description" :"Pectoral muscles of the upper front 
torso." },
{"name":"Core","description" :
"Abdominal and midsection muscles providing trunk stability." }
// ... more body part tags
]
}
Explanation of the structure:
We divided into sections for exerciseTerms  (jargon like AMRAP, superset), exercises  (actual
movement names), workoutStyles  (broad categories like HIIT, Strength, etc.), and also lists for 
equipment  and bodyParts  (which can serve as tags or for equipment recognition). Each entry has a
clear name/term and a definition or description. You can adjust the fields as needed (for example,
you might include an alias field if some exercises have multiple names, or an intensity  or 
unit field for certain terms).
This standardized JSON can be used by your parser . For instance, when parsing an Instagram caption: - If it
encounters a word like “EMOM” or “AMRAP,” it can look it up in  exerciseTerms  to understand it’s a
format and handle the structure accordingly (e.g., expecting a time or rep scheme).
- If it sees “push-ups” or “Back Squat,” it finds it in exercises  to know it’s an exercise name (not just a
random word) and perhaps tag the workout with the muscle groups or equipment (like add “barbell” to
equipment list if Back Squat is present, add “legs” to muscle group tags, etc.).
-  Hashtags  or  descriptions  like  “leg  day”  or  “HIIT  workout”  could  be  matched  to  bodyParts  or
workoutStyles  to tag the workout or provide context (e.g., categorize the workout as HIIT or focus on
legs). 
Efficiency of this structure:  Storing this data as a JSON in your app means lookups are just in-memory
object/array searches, which is extremely fast given the size. The app can load this JSON at startup (a few
kilobytes)  and  use  it  for  parsing  logic  without  additional  network  calls.  This  aligns  with  the  earlier
recommendation that a static JSON is plenty efficient for this use-case .
Finally, ensure to keep the glossary updated as you encounter new terms in the wild (e.g., if influencers
start using a new acronym or slang). With a structured reference and the parser logic tied to it, your Spotter
app will be well-equipped to interpret workout captions and map them to a structured format for users to
launch workouts. Good luck with building out the database and happy parsing!
