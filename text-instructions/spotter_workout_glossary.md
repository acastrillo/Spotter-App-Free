# Spotter: Workout & Exercise Jargon Glossary

## Fundamental Exercise Terms (Reps, Sets, Rounds, etc.)

- **Repetition (Rep)** — One complete movement of an exercise (e.g., one push‑up or one squat). Workouts often prescribe a number of reps to perform consecutively.
- **Set** — A group of consecutive repetitions performed without stopping. Example: *3 sets of 10 reps*.
- **Round** — Completing a series of different exercises one after another. Once every listed exercise is done, that counts as **1 round**.
- **Rest** — A pause between sets or rounds to recover (e.g., *90s rest*).
- **Warm‑Up Set** — A lighter set performed before the main working sets of an exercise to prime muscles and the nervous system.
- **Top Set** — The heaviest (or final) set of a given exercise in a workout; the peak effort for that movement.

## Workout Structure and Format Terms

- **Superset** — Perform two exercises back‑to‑back **without rest** in between, then rest after both.
- **Tri‑Set / Giant Set** — Three exercises (tri‑set) or four+ exercises (giant set) chained together without rest; rest after the sequence.
- **Circuit** — A sequence of several exercises performed one after another with minimal rest; completing one set of each is one circuit/round.
- **Drop Set** — Perform an exercise to near failure, immediately reduce the weight, and continue without rest.
- **Pyramid Set** — Increase weight and decrease reps each set (ascending pyramid) or the reverse; sometimes both directions.
- **Ladder** — Reps ascend or descend each set in a pattern (e.g., 1‑2‑3‑4‑5 or 10‑9‑8‑…‑1).
- **AMRAP** — *As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible.* Either as many reps in a set (to technical failure), or as many **rounds** of a circuit in a time window.
- **EMOM** — *Every Minute On the Minute.* Start prescribed work at the top of each minute; rest for the remainder of the minute.
- **Interval Training** — Alternating periods of higher intensity with lower intensity or rest (umbrella term that includes HIIT).
- **HIIT** — *High‑Intensity Interval Training.* Short bursts of intense work alternated with rests; typically 10–30 minutes total.
- **Tabata** — A specific HIIT protocol: 20s all‑out effort, 10s rest, repeated for 8 rounds (4 minutes total).
- **For Time** — Complete the prescribed work as fast as possible; record total time. May include a **time cap** (stop at the cap if unfinished).
- **Chipper** — A long single‑round list of movements/reps you “chip away” at, usually completed **for time**.
- **WOD** — *Workout Of the Day.* A named/prescribed workout (Common in CrossFit; may be AMRAP, EMOM, chipper, etc.).
- **Metcon** — *Metabolic Conditioning.* High‑intensity conditioning circuits that tax both muscular and cardiovascular systems.
- **Tempo** — The speed of each rep phase, often written as four digits (e.g., `3-1-1-0`: 3s eccentric, 1s pause, 1s concentric, 0s pause).
- **Time Cap** — Maximum time allowed to complete a workout/part.
- **RPE** — *Rate of Perceived Exertion* (usually 1–10). Sometimes used in strength templates to prescribe intensity.
- **RM** — *Rep Max.* 1RM = heaviest weight for a single rep; %1RM often used for load prescription.

## Types of Workouts and Training Styles

- **Strength Training** — Low‑to‑moderate reps with higher load to increase maximal strength (e.g., 1–6 reps, longer rests).
- **Hypertrophy (Bodybuilding)** — Moderate loads, moderate‑to‑high volume (e.g., 8–15 reps) to build muscle size; often uses isolation and intensity techniques.
- **Endurance Training** — Higher‑rep resistance work or steady aerobic work for sustained performance.
- **HIIT** — Short, intense intervals to improve anaerobic and aerobic capacity.
- **Circuit / Bootcamp** — Sequenced stations with little rest; blends strength and cardio.
- **CrossFit** — Mixed modal training (weightlifting, gymnastics, monostructural/cardio) with varied, often timed/scored WODs.
- **Powerlifting** — Focus on maximal strength in squat, bench press, and deadlift.
- **Olympic Weightlifting** — Focus on snatch and clean & jerk; low reps, high power/technique.
- **Bodyweight (Calisthenics)** — Using body mass as resistance (e.g., push‑ups, pull‑ups); scales from beginner to advanced skills.
- **Functional Training** — Multi‑joint, real‑life movement patterns (e.g., carries, swings, unilateral work) emphasizing stability and coordination.
- **Mobility / Flexibility** — Sessions to improve range of motion and joint health (e.g., yoga, mobility flows).
- **Metabolic Conditioning (Metcon)** — High‑intensity mixes of strength and cardio to elevate and sustain effort.

## Common Workout Focus and Split Terms

- **Full‑Body Workout** — Targets major upper, lower, and core muscle groups within a single session.
- **Upper/Lower Split** — Separate days for upper‑body and lower‑body work.
- **Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)** — Push (chest/shoulders/triceps), Pull (back/biceps), Legs (lower body).
- **Leg/Arm/Back/Chest Day** — Body‑part focused sessions typical of bodybuilding splits.
- **Core Workout** — Abdominals and trunk stability emphasis.
- **Cardio** — Primary aerobic focus; e.g., LISS (steady state) vs HIIT (intervals).

## Data Format Considerations (Database vs JSON for Next.js)

For a Next.js mobile web app, the workout/exercise glossary is relatively static and modest in size. **A single JSON (or small set of JSON files) bundled with the app is simplest and efficient.** Benefits:
- Zero external round‑trips for lookups.
- Easy in‑memory search and parsing in the client or server components.
- Straightforward versioning and updates.
- Future‑proof: can be migrated to a DB later if the glossary becomes dynamic/user‑editable.

## Proposed Data Template/Standard (JSON Structure)

Use a small set of collections to support parsing and UI tagging. Add `aliases` for normalization and optional `units` hints for parsing.

### Notes for Parser Integration
- **Normalization:** Match on lowercase and strip punctuation; check `aliases` to canonicalize to `term`/`name`.
- **Units hints:** Use `units` to prioritize parsing tokens (`reps`, `time`, `distance`, `load`, `calories`).
- **Tagging:** Add `equipment` and `bodyParts` tags when exercises are detected; attach `workoutStyles` when formats (e.g., HIIT, CrossFit) or structures (AMRAP/EMOM) appear.
- **Extensibility:** As you encounter new slang or movements, append to `aliases` to improve recall without changing parser code.
